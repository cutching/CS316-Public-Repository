# *Near Real-time Anomaly Detection*
## *Capital One*
## *Short Project Description*
Anomaly detection of entity behavior from event logs is possible by collecting data from various data sources and calculating the risk scores on current activity based on activity deviation from historical data.
Train the models in batch process and consume the models for near real-time detections. Is it possible to design a near real-time anomaly detection system? We need a streaming approach to detect anomalies using event streams and pre-trained models.

The directory structure in this GitHub is to allow the project to have all its resources self-contained.
Open Source software should not just be a repository of code.  There are a number of directories to help you and others that will 
follow in your foot steps.  It'll also allow the Linux Foundation OMP Mentorship program to keep track of your project and get
a better understanding of the problems you encountered during the developmemnt of this project.

| Folder | Description |
|---|---|
| Documentation |  all documentation the project team has created to describe the architecture, design, installation and configuratin of the peoject |
| Notes and Research | Relavent information useful to understand the tools and techniques used in the project |
| Status Reports | Project management documentation - weekly reports, milestones, etc. |
| scr | Source code - create as many subdirectories as needed |
