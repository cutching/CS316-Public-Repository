# *AWS S3*
## *Implementation Guide*
S3 is extremely straight forward.
The steps are as follows:
1. Create bucket
2. Name your bucket something relevant
3. Put your tar file that you created into the S3 bucket
##
Whatever you name the S3 bucket is the name you will used in all other code when trying to reference your model artifacts.
